<h2 id="is-my-rn-representative-of-the-true-rn-of-the-local-community">Is my RN representative of the “true” RN of the local
community?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-my-rn-representative-of-the-true-rn-of-the-local-community"></a>
</h2>
<p>The basic parameters of a RN are its <em>order</em> (number of nodes:
<em>S</em>) and <em>size</em> (number of links: <em>l</em>). The ratio
of the size to the square of order is the <em>connectance</em> of the
network: <span class="math inline">\(C = l/S^2\)</span> (proportion of
the maximum possible number of links that are actually realized). An
important preliminary step before the analysis of the RN is determining
to which extent our sampling provides a good approximation to estimate
these basic parameters for the “real” RN.</p>
<p>It is well known in community ecology that estimates of <em>S</em>
depend on sampling effort, and there is ample literature on how to
determine the completeness of the list of species sampled in a local
assemblage (see Chao et al. 2020 and references therein). The same
problem affects the estimation of the number of links that can take
place in a local assemblage. Even if we scan a locality inch by inch,
some interactions may not be realized within the scanned area just by
chance. Besides, the frequency of some interactions may be too low to be
detected with a limited sampling effort, and some canopy species may
pose difficulties to searching beneath them (e.g. those covered by
spines or thorns). The studies that have assessed the completeness of
ecological networks (Goldwasser and Roughgarden 1997, Nielsen and
Bascompte 2007, Rivera-Hutinel et al. 2012, Costa et al. 2016,
Vizentin-Bugoni et al. 2016, Pulgar et al. 2017, Henriksen et al 2019)
agree in that the level of sampling effort needed for a good coverage of
the links present in a network is much larger than the effort needed to
obtain a good coverage of the number of species in the local assemblage.
This implies that <em>C</em> may often be underestimated and that other
properties of the network can also be affected. Networks inferred with
insufficient or biased data will lead to biased or totally wrong
conclusions. This was a fundamental flaw in the early studies on food
webs that slowed down the development of this field (Pascual &amp; Dunne
2006).</p>
<p>Analytical procedures developed to estimate species richness can be
adapted for the study of interactions in ecological networks, simply
treating each link as if it was a “species” and its frequency as
equivalent to species abundance (Chacoff et al. 2012, Jordano 2016, Chiu
et al. 2023). Particularly interesting is the adaptation for the study
of interaction networks made by Chiu et al. (2023) of the methods for
the analysis of completeness developed by Chao et al. (2014, 2020) based
in Hill’s numbers (<em>q</em>). In the context of ecological networks,
we are mostly interested in the Hill’s numbers of order 0 and 1 as
applied to species and interactions counts. Hill’s number of order 0
(<em>q0</em>) estimated with the whole sample is simply the observed
number of species or links (<em>q0<sub>obs</sub></em>). But the observed
number underestimates the real number, so we need an estimate of the
real <em>q0<sub>est</sub></em>, which can be obtained using
non-parametric estimators (e.g, Chao1, Chao2, ACE or ICE). Using the
non-parametric estimate as reference, we can estimate the completeness
of <em>q0</em> as <span class="math inline">\(^0^C =
q0~obs~/q0~est~\)</span>. In turn, Hill’s number of order 1
(<em>q<sub>1</sub></em>) is the exponential of Shannon’s index of
diversity. Differently from <em>q0</em>, <em>q1</em> incorporates
information on the relative frequencies. The completeness of
<em>q<sub>1</sub></em> (<em><sup>1</sup>C</em>) is most often referred
to as “coverage”, and indicates the proportion of the total number of
individuals of any species, or of events of any interaction, occurring
the real community that belong to species or links that have already
been sampled.</p>
<p>The counts to estimate the number of species or links can be obtained
by means of different sampling schemes but, in general, there are two
types of counting: abundance counts and incidence counts (a.k.a.
occurrence or presence counts) (Gotelli and Colwell 2001). Cases
(defined as independent individuals of any species or as occurrences of
any link in different sampling units) are randomly sampled from the
whole set of cases in the local assemblage. In abundance counts, the
cases are counted individually, as when counting the number of recruits
of each species in a plot. Incidence counts are used when individual
cases cannot be clearly distinguished to be counted (e.g. when counting
clonal plants or corals) or when they cannot be considered as
independent samples (e.g. multiple individual ants of the same species
falling in a pit-fall trap). In these cases, we count the number of
times each species or link is detected across multiple samples, and
these samples are considered as randomly chosen “replicates” of the
local community. When estimating species richness, incidence-based
estimates are less sensitive to the spatial aggregation of individuals
than abundance-based estimates (Chazdon et al. 1998, Colwell et
al. 2004, Chao et al. 2014).</p>
<p>Incidence data have another interesting advantage over abundance data
in the context of networks: when each sample is sufficiently large to be
considered as a replicate of the local community, the stability of
network descriptors against sampling effort can be estimated (Nielsen
and Bascompte 2007, Costa et al. 2016, Pulgar et al. 2017). Basically,
if we sample canopy-recruit interactions in <em>N</em> plots, we can use
the following process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Build the partial RN of each of the <em>N</em> plots.</li>
<li>Combine the partial RNs of <em>k</em> (see explanation below)
randomly chosen pairs of plots, obtain their metric and calculate the
mean and 95%CL. This is the value with sampling effort
<em>n</em>=2.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for all the levels of sampling effort up to
<em>n</em>=<em>N</em>-2 plots.</li>
</ol>
<p>The metrics for sampling effort of <em>n</em>=1 plot and for
<em>n</em>=<em>N</em>-1 plots can only be based on <em>N</em> different
values (one for each of the <em>N</em> plots or one per each of the
<em>N</em> possible combination of <em>N</em>-1 plots). However, the
number of random combinations (<em>k</em>) of <em>n</em> = 2, 3 …
<em>N</em>-2 partial RNs can be much larger than <em>N</em>
(i.e. combinations of <em>N</em> partial RNs taken <em>n</em> at a
time). Therefore, to obtain comparable confidence intervals across
levels of sampling effort, <em>k</em> must be constant in all levels.
The value of <em>k</em> should not be too small so that the confidence
intervals are obtained for a large number of random combinations. For
example, with <em>N</em>=20 plots, there are 20 possible combinations of
1 (or of <em>N</em>-1) plots, 190 possible combinations of 2 (or of
<em>N</em>-2) plots and 1140 possible combinations of 3 (or of
<em>N</em>-3) plots. In this example, if we set <em>k</em> = 100, then
we could estimate the effect of sampling effort for <em>n</em> in the
range between 2 and 18 plots.</p>
<p>This procedure allows determining whether the value of each network
metric stabilizes within the sampling effort of the survey.</p>
<p>To address the quality of a dataset for the study of recruitment
networks, we will determine (1) the completeness
(<em><sup>0</sup>C</em>) and coverage (<em><sup>1</sup>C</em>) of the
number of species and links detected, and (2) the stability of network
metrics to sampling effort.</p>

</h3>
<p>The following analyses apply to data collected using the Recruitment
Network protocol described in Alcantara et al. (2019), which involves
partial RNs sampled in multiple plots. Accordingly, to obtain
completeness and coverage estimates for a recruitment network, we will
use <strong>iNEXT</strong> package (Hsieh et al. 2016) for incidence
data.</p>
