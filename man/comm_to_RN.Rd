\title{Merge cover data with interaction data for a given site}
\usage{
comm_to_RN(RN_data = NULL, cover_data = NULL, site = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{RN_data}{data set where recruitment networks are stored.
Usually, it will be "RecruitNet" (or the name assigned to the dataset when it was imported).}

\item{cover_data}{data set where cover data is stored.
Usually, it will be "CanopyCover" (or the name assigned to the dataset
"CanopyCover.csv" when it was imported).}

\item{site}{name of the study site.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing 7 columns with all the information needed
for the basic analysis of recruitment networks and canopy-recruit interactions:
canopy species (Canopy), recruit species (Recruit), recruitment frequency (fij),
Tij = TODO,
Pij = TODO,
cover of the canopy (cj) and cover of the recruit (ci).
}
\description{
This function returns a data frame that merges the information from the
recruitment network and species cover for a local community.
It is a shortcut to directly obtain the data for a local community
from the RecruitNet dataset.

\examples{
data(RecruitNet)
data(CanopyCover)
Ventisquero_RNc <- comm_to_RN(RecruitNet, CanopyCover, site = "Ventisquero")
