\title{Function RN_matrixForm}
\usage{
RN_to_matrix(RNdata = NULL, weight = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{RNdata}{A data frame generated with \code{\link[=comm_subset]{comm_subset()}} or a data.frame
containing columns with all the information needed for the basic analysis of
recruitment networks: canopy species (canopy), recruit species (recruit),
cover of the canopy (cj) and recruit (ci),
and columns with possible weighting variables.}

\item{weight}{The name of the column of the data frame to be used as weight
variable for the links.}
}
\value{
A matrix object with the species names as row (recruit species) and
column names (canopy species), and cells indicating the chosen weight for
each interaction. For example, the output of function local_RN provides the
number of recruits of species i interacting with canopy species j (fij),
the number of plots (i.e. incidence) where the interaction has been found (Tij),
and the binary presence/absence of the interaction in the whole study site (Pij).
Can be used as bipartite input.
}
\description{
For some analyses, the data must be stored as a matrix rather than data frame.
The next function takes a RN stored as data frame and transforms it into a matrix.
The output matrix can be used input for bipartite package.

data(RecruitNet)
data(CanopyCover)
Ventisquero_RNc <- comm_to_RN(RecruitNet, CanopyCover, site = "Ventisquero")
Ventisquero_matrix <- RN_to_matrix(Ventisquero_RNc, weight = "fij")
Ventisquero_matrix <- RN_to_matrix(Ventisquero_RNc, weight = "Tij")
